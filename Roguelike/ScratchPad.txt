  For each block
  {
     if the block is within the players view radius
     {
        draw a virtual line from the player to the block
        for each block on the line
        {
           set it as visible initially
           if it is a wall/door/object that blocks vision, or any previous blocks have been blocking objects
           {
              the block = non-visible
           }
